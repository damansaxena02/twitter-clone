## 🧠 About the Project

This project is a **frontend clone** of Twitter designed using **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework. The purpose of this project is to practice frontend UI development, learn layout design, flex/grid systems, and build something visually similar to a real-world product.

This clone includes all the major UI sections of Twitter:
- Sidebar with icons (Home, Explore, Notifications, etc.)
- Main feed with sample tweets
- Profile area and tweet button
- Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop

It's a perfect example of how Tailwind CSS can be used to quickly and efficiently build a production-ready layout.
